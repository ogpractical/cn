Protects access to privileged EXEC mode (Router# / Switch#)

Prevents unauthorized configuration changes

Enhances network security

Ensures only authorized users can manage the device



---

b) Explain the role of VLAN1 in a switch’s initial configuration.

Answer:

VLAN1 is the default VLAN on a switch

All ports belong to VLAN1 initially

Used for management and initial communication

c) Configure Static NAT on a router using Cisco Packet Tracer or GNS3. Assign a public IP to a private IP.

Answer:

enable
configure terminal

interface gig0/0
ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
ip nat inside
no shutdown

interface gig0/1
ip address 200.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
ip nat outside
no shutdown

ip nat inside source static 192.168.1.10 200.1.1.10
exit


---

d) Configure Dynamic NAT with a pool of public IP addresses.

Answer:

enable
configure terminal

access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255

ip nat pool MYPOOL 200.1.1.1 200.1.1.10 netmask 255.255.255.0

ip nat inside source list 1 pool MYPOOL

interface gig0/0
ip nat inside

interface gig0/1
ip nat outside


---

f) Define Hashing.

Answer: Hashing is the process of converting data into a fixed-size value (hash) using a hash function.

Used for data integrity and security

Common in password storage

Example: SHA, MD5



---

g) What are Cyber Security Policies?

Answer: Cyber security policies are rules and guidelines designed to protect systems and data.

Define acceptable use

Ensure data protection

Prevent unauthorized access

Help in risk management

Q2) B) Write a program to verify the configuration using show running-config and ping commands.

Answer:

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int choice;

    printf("1. Show Running Configuration\n");
    printf("2. Ping Test\n");
    printf("Enter your choice: ");
    scanf("%d", &choice);

    switch(choice) {
        case 1:
            printf("Displaying running configuration...\n");
            printf("Interface: Gig0/0\nIP: 192.168.1.1\nStatus: UP\n");
            break;

        case 2:
            printf("Pinging 8.8.8.8...\n");
            printf("Reply from 8.8.8.8: bytes=32 time=20ms TTL=64\n");
            break;

        default:
            printf("Invalid choice\n");
    }

    return 0;
}

Q2) B) Write a program to set up a dynamic routing protocol such as RIP, EIGRP or OSPF.

Answer (Example: RIP Configuration):

enable
configure terminal

router rip
version 2
network 192.168.1.0
network 10.0.0.0
no auto-summary

exit

OR (EIGRP):

router eigrp 100
network 192.168.1.0
no auto-summary

OR (OSPF):

router ospf 1
network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 0
